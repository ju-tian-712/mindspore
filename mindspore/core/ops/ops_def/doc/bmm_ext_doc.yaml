bmm_ext:
  description: |
    Performs batch matrix-matrix multiplication of two three-dimensional tensors.

    .. math::
        \text{output}[b, i, j] = \text{input}[b, i, k] @ \text{mat2}[b, k, j]

    Args:
        input (Tensor): The first batch of matrices to be multiplied. Must be a three-dimensional tensor.
        mat2 (Tensor): The second batch of matrices to be multiplied. Must be a three-dimensional tensor.

    Returns:
        Tensor, the output tensor of shape `(b, n, p)`, where each matrix is the product of the corresponding matrices in the input batches.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `input` or `mat2` is not three-dimensional tensors.
        ValueError: If the length of the third dimension of `input` is not equal to the length of the second dimension of `mat2`.
        ValueError: If the batch size of the inputs do not match.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU`` ``CPU``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from mindspore import Tensor
        >>> from mindspore import ops
        >>> a = Tensor(np.ones(shape=[2, 3, 4]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> b = Tensor(np.ones(shape=[2, 4, 5]), mindspore.float32)
        >>> output = ops.auto_generate.bmm_ext(a, b)
        >>> print(output.shape)
        (2, 3, 5)
