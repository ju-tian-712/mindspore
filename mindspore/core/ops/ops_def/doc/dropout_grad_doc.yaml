dropout:
  description: |
    The gradient of Dropout. During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements
    of the input tensor with probability.

    Args:
        mask (tensor): The mask applied to 'x'.
        keep_prob (float): The keep rate, between 0 and 1, e.g. keep_prob = 0.9,
          means dropping out 10% of input units. Default: 0.5.

    Inputs:
        - **x** (tuple[int]) - The shape of target mask.

    Outputs:
        Tensor, the value of generated mask for input shape.

    Examples:
        >>> dropout_grad = ops.DropoutGrad(keep_prob=0.5)
        >>> in = Tensor((20, 16, 50, 50))
        >>> out = dropout_grad(in)
